// This script extracts the first frame from each video and saves it as a poster image
// It can be run manually to generate poster images for all videos

// Note: This is a placeholder script. In a real implementation, you would use
// a library like ffmpeg.js to extract frames from videos client-side,
// or use a server-side process to generate these images.
